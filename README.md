Java Chapter We've started a new shared library to enable reusing various Kafka components (in particular reactor-kafka).  You can check it out here: https://github.com/Maersk-Global/shared-kafka-utils (better documentation will follow). For now, the library provides the following:


	
Out of the box Kafka health check, that can be added to your actuator liveness and readiness groups
	
Utilities for handling deserialization errors in consumers

Looking forward to hearing your feedback. Please get in touch if you have any other components or utilities which you think should be part of this.
